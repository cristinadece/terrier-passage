Dillard said then that the equipment, valued at $1,300, was in a locked trailer parked behind the EMS station on Rose Avenue in Decatur. \\n \\nIn February, the trailer was discovered unlocked and the generator missing. Dillard said a text message was sent to all EMS employees asking if anyone had borrowed it or knew where it was located. No one responded. \\n \\n“Charles, as department head, I would have them in there every day, measuring the length of their toenails or whatever …,” White said, emphasizing the need for Dillard to dig deeper. \\n \\n“Sir, I turned it over to the the sheriff’s office. I thought that’s what you were supposed to do,” Dillard said. \\n \\nWhite asked if any meetings were held about the issue, and Dillard said he talked to the supervisor at the station where the generator was kept. \\n \\n“No one seems to know anything about it or where it is other than one day they went to check on it, and it was gone,” Dillard said. \\n \\nCounty Judge J.D. Clark said Dillard should have a “come to Jesus meeting” with the staff. \\n \\n“I’m not 100 percent sure it’s someone there,” Dillard replied. \\n \\nWhite insisted Dillard get to the bottom of it. \\n \\n“If I have to ask every court what the status of this is, I will,” he said.', 'source': 'Wise County Messenger', 'published': '2015-09-20T18:42:03Z', 'id': '654ff049-892d-4656-bbaf-70a0b4f86bce'}}\n",
