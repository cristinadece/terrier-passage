This compares with only 24 percent who had predicted improved results for the 1996 business year.\\nInvestments in 1997 were expected to remain at year-ago levels, at around three billion marks, Wagner said.\\nSuffering under the effects of a soft first quarter last year, the industry posted total sales of around 65.8 billion marks, down 1.6 percent from 1995 levels, the group said.\\nWagner explained that a surge in production in the second half of 1996 helped recover some ground lost when production dropped about 8.5 percent during the first quarter 1996.\\nPrices droppped by only 0.8 percent, he added.\\nWagner said the industry had largely completed its downsizing which meant that jobs, reduced by about 8,000 to 270,000 last year, would be secure for some time.\\nIn fact the industry was encountering difficulties in filling available jobs with not all 1,000 trainee positions taken up.\\n--Svea Herbst-Bayliss, Frankfurt Newsroom, +49 69 756525', 'categories': ['C21', 'C31', 'CCAT']}}\n",
